# Music-Clustering-and-Recommendation

## The Idea

There a many genres and sub-genres in music. Many people have a favorite genre and predominantly explore songs in this category.
However, there might be songs that are similar to your favorite tracks but you never listen to them because they are in a different genre and the algorithm therefore is less likely to recommend these songs to you.

In this project we want to find out which songs are similar to each other but looking at the actual data of the sounds, hundreds of different features such as ...
Based on clusters of similarity we build a prototype recommender system that enhances the user experience.
